## **How It Works**  

1. **Sign Up**: Borrowers and lenders create profiles and connect their blockchain wallets.  
2. **Request Loan**: Borrowers submit loan requests with details such as amount, repayment terms, and purpose.  
3. **Loan Matching**: The platform matches loan requests with lenders, either directly or via pooled funds.  
4. **Disbursement**: Once funded, the loan is disbursed to the borrowerâ€™s wallet.  
5. **Repayment**: Borrowers make scheduled repayments, tracked on-chain, with notifications sent for due dates.  
6. **Completion**: After full repayment, borrowers improve their reputation scores, enabling better terms for future loans.

## **Roadmap**  

- **MVP**: Core lending and repayment features, secure wallet integration.  
- **Phase 2**: Implement reputation system, tokenized lending pools, and analytics dashboard.  
- **Phase 3**: Expand to include community governance and dispute resolution mechanisms.  
- **Phase 4**: Partner with NGOs and financial institutions to enhance scalability and reach.
